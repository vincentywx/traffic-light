# traffic-light

#### 1 Introduction
You are required to provide the code for an application that simulates a set of traffic lights at
an intersection.

The traffic lights are designated (N, S) and (E, W) like a compass.
#### 2 Requirements
When switching from green to red, the yellow light must be displayed for 30 seconds prior to
it switching to red. The lights will change automatically every 5 minutes.

You're not required to optimize the solution, just focus on a functional approach to
requirements.

Provide the output for the light changes which occur during a given thirty minute period.
You must provide unit tests for all logic.
Create a repo on bitbucket/github and provide the link as well as instructions on how to run.
